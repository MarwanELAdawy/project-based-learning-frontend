# Project Based Learning - Frontend

Frontend development is challenging to learn. What helped me a lot was not only to learn theory, but to program something every day. If you are a beginner or already working as a frontend developer or designer you can benefit from this list. 

### Support Projects like these
If this list helps you, I'd be happy if you'd support me. You can buy stickers or support me directly via buy me a coffee. This enables me to do many more such projects and to keep this list up to date. 

You can do this either by buying [stickers or T-shirts](https://teespring.com/stores/webdev-4) or by supporting me directly via [Buy me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/binconsole)

Thank you.
